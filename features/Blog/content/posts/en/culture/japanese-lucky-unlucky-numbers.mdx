## Why Numbers Have Meaning in Japan

Japanese number superstitions come from two sources:

### 1. Pronunciation Associations

Japanese numbers can sound like other words, creating connections:

- 4 (四 - shi) sounds like 死 (shi - death) 💀
- 8 (八 - hachi) looks like expanding ∞ = prosperity! 💰

### 2. Visual Symbolism

The shape of characters creates meaning:

- 八 (8) spreads outward = growth
- 四 (4) is enclosed = trapped/ending

### 3. Religious & Cultural History

Buddhism, Shinto, and Chinese influence all shaped number beliefs.

## Unlucky Numbers 💀

### 4 (四 - Shi) ⚠️

**The Dreaded Number!**

4 is Japan's unluckiest number because 四 (shi) sounds exactly like 死 (shi = death).

**Where you'll notice it:**

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Place</th>
      <th>What Happens</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Hospitals</td>
      <td>No Room 4, Floor 4, or Bed 4</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Hotels</td>
      <td>4th floor often skipped</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Apartments</td>
      <td>No Unit 4</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Parking</td>
      <td>Space 4 avoided</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Products</td>
      <td>Sets of 4 uncommon</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Phone numbers</td>
      <td>People avoid numbers with 4</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

**Gift taboo:** Never give 4 of something (4 flowers, 4 items)!

**Fun fact:** Some buildings go 1, 2, 3, 5... with no 4th floor at all!

**Workaround:** Use よん (yon) instead of し (shi) to avoid the death association. Both readings exist!

---

### 9 (九 - Ku) ⚠️

**The Suffering Number**

9 is unlucky because 九 (ku) sounds like 苦 (ku = suffering/pain).

**Where it matters:**

- Hospitals avoid room 9 and 49 (shi-ku = death + suffering 😱)
- Some buildings skip 9th floor
- Gifts in sets of 9 are avoided

**Double trouble:** 49 (四九 - shi-ku) combines death AND suffering. Extremely avoided!

<InfoBox type='warning'>
  NEVER give 4 or 9 items as gifts in Japan! This is considered very rude or
  ominous. Give 3, 5, or 8 items instead.
</InfoBox>

---

### 13 (十三 - Juusan)

**Western Import**

13 isn't traditionally unlucky in Japan, but Western influence has made some people cautious about it – especially in international contexts.

---

### 42 (四二 - Shi-Ni)

**Death is Coming**

42 sounds like 死に (shini = "to death" or "dying"). Some hospitals have no Room 42!

---

### 43 (四三 - Shi-San)

**Stillbirth**

43 sounds like 死産 (shizan = stillbirth). Avoided in maternity wards.

---

## Lucky Numbers 🍀

### 7 (七 - Shichi/Nana) 🎰

**The Lucky Seven**

7 is lucky in Japan, partly from Buddhist tradition (Seven Lucky Gods - 七福神) and partly from Western influence.

**Where you see it:**

- Pachinko/slots: 777 = jackpot! 🎰
- Seven Lucky Gods (Shichifukujin)
- 7-Eleven convenience stores
- Lucky dates with 7

**Cultural note:** 七五三 (Shichi-go-san) is a festival for children aged 7, 5, and 3 – all auspicious ages!

---

### 8 (八 - Hachi) 💰

**The Prosperity Number**

8 is considered the LUCKIEST number in Japan!

**Why it's lucky:**

- 八 looks like it's spreading/expanding at the bottom = growth & prosperity
- Associated with increasing fortune
- Eight is beyond seven (completeness + 1)

**Where you see it:**

- Business names often include 8
- Lucky phone numbers with many 8s
- Dates with 8 preferred for openings
- 富士山 (Mt. Fuji) = 2,236m base, often written 8,848... wait, that's Everest! But 8 is still lucky 😄

**Example:** Car license plates with 8888 are VERY expensive in Japan!

---

### 3 (三 - San) ✨

**The Harmony Number**

3 represents harmony and completeness:

- Many things come in 3s in Japanese culture
- 三種の神器 (Three Sacred Treasures)
- Easier to remember than 4 items!

**Gift giving:** 3 is a safe, pleasant number for gifts.

---

### 5 (五 - Go) ⭐

**The Balance Number**

5 represents balance (5 elements, 5 senses):

- Often used in formal occasions
- 五穀豊穣 (abundant grain harvest)
- Safe for gifts!

## Wordplay Numbers 🔤

Japanese LOVES number wordplay! Phone numbers and codes use number readings creatively:

## Real-World Examples 🏢

### Buildings & Floors

Many Japanese buildings avoid unlucky floor numbers:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Floor</th>
      <th>Status</th>
      <th>Notes</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>1F</td>
      <td>✅ OK</td>
      <td>-</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>2F</td>
      <td>✅ OK</td>
      <td>-</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>3F</td>
      <td>✅ OK</td>
      <td>-</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>4F</td>
      <td>❌ SKIPPED</td>
      <td>Death floor</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>5F</td>
      <td>✅ OK</td>
      <td>(Called 4F in reality)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>9F</td>
      <td>⚠️ Sometimes skipped</td>
      <td>Suffering</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>13F</td>
      <td>⚠️ Sometimes skipped</td>
      <td>Western influence</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Some buildings: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10... 🤯

### Hospital Rooms

Hospitals are VERY careful about numbers:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Room</th>
      <th>Status</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Room 4</td>
      <td>❌ Never</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Room 9</td>
      <td>❌ Avoided</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Room 42</td>
      <td>❌ Never (death-bound)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Room 43</td>
      <td>❌ Never (stillbirth)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Room 49</td>
      <td>❌ NEVER (death + suffering)</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### Car License Plates

Popular plates with lucky numbers cost MORE:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Plate</th>
      <th>Price</th>
      <th>Why</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>8888</td>
      <td>¥¥¥</td>
      <td>Maximum luck!</td>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Contains 4</td>
      <td>Cheaper</td>
      <td>Bad luck</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### Wedding Dates

Couples check calendars carefully:

**Lucky dates:** 8th, 18th, 28th of months
**Avoided:** 4th, 9th, dates adding to 4 or 9

## Pop Culture & Anime References 🎌

### In Anime

- **Room/locker 4** = Bad omen incoming!
- **Character wearing 4** = Death flags! 🚩
- **777 appearing** = Jackpot moment
- **4:44 on a clock** = Spooky time

### In Gaming

- **HP or damage = 444** = References death
- **Lucky items** = Often come in 7s or 8s
- **Boss floor** = Sometimes floor 4 or 13

### In Music

**AKB48** - Not 47 or 49 because:

- 47 = less popular
- 48 = 4 + 8 = interesting balance
- 49 = death + suffering combo!

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do young Japanese people believe this?

Mostly awareness rather than belief. They might not care about 4th floor apartments, but would still avoid giving 4 items as gifts.

### Are there lucky dates for travel?

Some people check 六曜 (rokuyo - a calendar system) for lucky/unlucky days. 大安 (taian) is the luckiest!

### What about Western numbers like 13?

Growing awareness due to Western influence, but not as significant as 4 and 9.

### Do I really need to worry about this?

For gifts: YES! For everyday life: awareness helps but don't stress!
