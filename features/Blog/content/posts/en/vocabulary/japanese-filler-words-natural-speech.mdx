Here's a secret that textbooks don't teach: native Japanese speakers use filler words CONSTANTLY. Words like えーと, あのう, and なんか fill pauses, buy thinking time, and make speech sound natural.

Without these words, your Japanese sounds robotic. With them? You sound like a real person having a real conversation! 🗣️

<InfoBox type='success'>
  Learning filler words is one of the fastest ways to sound more natural. They
  buy you thinking time AND make you sound fluent – even when you're still
  searching for the next word!
</InfoBox>

## Why Filler Words Matter

### 🎯 They Buy You Time

Need a second to think? Say えーと instead of awkward silence!

### 🎭 They Sound Human

Perfect, pause-free speech sounds unnatural. Even native speakers hesitate!

### 🔗 They Connect Ideas

Fillers smooth transitions between thoughts, making speech flow better.

### 😌 They Reduce Pressure

Using fillers takes pressure off – you don't need perfect instant responses.

## The Essential Filler Words 📢

### 1. えーと / えーっと (Eeto / Eetto)

**English equivalent:** "Um...", "Uh...", "Let me see..."

The MOST common Japanese filler! Use it when thinking.

**Usage:**

> A: 何を食べたい？(What do you want to eat?)
> B: **えーと**...ラーメンかな。(**Umm**...maybe ramen.)

**Variations:**

- えー (ee) – shorter
- えーっと (eetto) – drawn out for more thinking time
- えーとね (eeto ne) – softer, feminine

---

### 2. あのう / あの (Anou / Ano)

**English equivalent:** "Uh...", "Excuse me...", "Well..."

Polite hesitation. Perfect for getting someone's attention or softening a question.

**Usage:**

> **あのう**、すみません... (**Excuse me**, sorry...)
> **あの**、ちょっといいですか？(**Um**, do you have a moment?)

**When to use:**

- Before asking a stranger something

### 3. なんか (Nanka)

> **なんか**いいね！(**Something** about it is nice!)

  the Japanese equivalent of saying "like" too much in English!

## How to Practice Filler Words

### 1. Shadow Native Speakers

Watch Japanese content and repeat exactly how they hesitate and connect ideas.

### 2. Practice Thinking Aloud

When studying alone, narrate your thoughts using えーと and なんか.

### 3. Record Yourself

Make voice memos in Japanese. Use fillers to keep talking even when unsure.

### 4. Start with Three

Master えーと, あのう, and なんか first. They cover 80% of filler situations!

### 5. Notice Overuse

Like English "um" and "like," too many fillers can be distracting. Use naturally!
