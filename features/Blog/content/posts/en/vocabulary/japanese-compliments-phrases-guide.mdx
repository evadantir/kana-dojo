## How Japanese Compliments Work 🎌

Before we dive in, understand these cultural points:

### Key Differences from English

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Aspect</th>
      <th>English</th>
      <th>Japanese</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Response</td>
      <td>"Thank you!"</td>
      <td>Often humble denial first</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Frequency</td>
      <td>Common</td>
      <td>More selective (feels more sincere)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Directness</td>
      <td>Very direct</td>
      <td>Often indirect or general</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Physical appearance</td>
      <td>Common</td>
      <td>More careful/selective</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### The Humble Response Pattern

When Japanese people receive compliments, they often deflect:

> A: 日本語がお上手ですね！ (Your Japanese is great!)
> B: いいえ、まだまだです。 (No no, I still have a long way to go.)

<InfoBox type='tip'>
  Don't be offended if someone deflects your compliment! It's humble, not
  dismissive. And when YOU receive compliments, you can simply say
  ありがとうございます while remaining modest.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is it okay to compliment strangers in Japan?

It depends on context. Complimenting service staff on their work or someone's pet is generally fine. Personal appearance compliments to strangers might feel uncomfortable. When in doubt, stick to situational compliments.

### How often should I give compliments?

Less frequently than in Western cultures, but sincerely. A well-timed, genuine compliment means more than constant praise. Quality over quantity!

### What if someone deflects my compliment repeatedly?

It's normal! You can simply smile and say 本当ですよ (Hontou desu yo - "It's true!") once, then let it go. Pushing too hard might make them uncomfortable.
