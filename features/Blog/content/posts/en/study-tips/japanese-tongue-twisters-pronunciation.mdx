## Why Tongue Twisters Help Your Japanese

### 🎯 Precision Practice

They force you to articulate clearly – no mumbling allowed!

### 🏃 Speed Training

Start slow, then speed up. Your mouth learns muscle memory.

### 😂 Fun Factor

Way more entertaining than repeating textbook phrases!

### 🔊 Sound Distinction

Many target similar sounds (like ら/な or き/ひ) that trip up learners.
