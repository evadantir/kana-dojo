## Which Should You Choose?

### Choose Kana.Pro if:

- You specifically want only kana learning
- You prefer the most minimal possible interface
- You're already using it and comfortable
- You only need the basics

### Choose KanaDojo if:

- You want a complete Japanese learning journey
- You plan to continue beyond kana to Kanji and vocabulary
- You're preparing for JLPT exams
- You value customization and aesthetics
- You want multiple training modes to stay engaged
- You prefer an ad-free, privacy-focused experience
- You want detailed progress tracking
- You appreciate regular updates and new features

## Learning Effectiveness

**Variety Matters**: Research shows that varied practice methods improve retention. KanaDojo's 6 different training modes provide this variety naturally, while Kana.Pro's more limited approach may lead to monotony.

**Long-term Value**: If you're serious about learning Japanese, you'll eventually need Kanji and vocabulary. KanaDojo lets you transition seamlessly without changing platforms.

**Motivation**: The achievement system, customizable themes, and detailed progress tracking in KanaDojo help maintain motivation over long periods.

## Real-World Usage

**For Absolute Beginners**: Both platforms work well for starting with Hiragana and Katakana. KanaDojo's extra features won't overwhelm you since you can start simple and gradually explore more.

**For Serious Learners**: KanaDojo is the clear choice. You won't outgrow it, and you'll appreciate the depth as you progress.

**For JLPT Students**: KanaDojo is essential. Kana.Pro simply doesn't cover the Kanji and vocabulary you need.

## The Bottom Line

While Kana.Pro is a decent tool for basic kana learning, **KanaDojo offers substantially more value**:

✅ **Comprehensive**: Kana + Kanji + Vocabulary in one platform
✅ **Engaging**: 6 training modes keep practice fresh
✅ **Beautiful**: 100+ themes and 28 fonts for personalization
✅ **Insightful**: Advanced progress tracking and analytics
✅ **Free**: Completely free, no ads, no catches
✅ **Scalable**: Grows with you from beginner to advanced

**Our Verdict**: Unless you have a specific preference for Kana.Pro's particular style, **KanaDojo provides better value and a more complete learning experience** for Japanese learners at any level.

## Try Them Both

Since both are free to try, we recommend testing each one. However, most learners find that KanaDojo's additional features and content make it the better long-term choice.
