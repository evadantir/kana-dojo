## Common Questions

### "Is Duolingo bad for Japanese?"

Not "bad," but **not optimal**. Duolingo's strength is making language learning accessible and fun. For Japanese specifically, the writing systems and Kanji require more specialized focus than Duolingo provides.

### "Can I use KanaDojo AND Duolingo?"

Absolutely! Many learners use:

- **KanaDojo** for Hiragana, Katakana, and Kanji mastery
- **Duolingo** for grammar and sentence construction practice

They complement each other well.

### "What's the fastest way to learn Japanese?"

There's no magic bullet, but the most effective approach combines:

1. Master Hiragana and Katakana thoroughly (KanaDojo excels here)
2. Build Kanji knowledge systematically (KanaDojo's JLPT organization helps)
3. Learn grammar through structured resources
4. Practice with native materials

Speed comes from consistency and using effective tools - not from rushing through gamified lessons.
